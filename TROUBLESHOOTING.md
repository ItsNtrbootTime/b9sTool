A. If you get an a9lh or shadowNAND "brick avoided" error. 
- Wait. We should have a b9sTool update that safely gets you past this dire warning within a few days (this edit was made 12/14/2019).<br>
Visit this Discord channel if you have any questions: https://discord.gg/C29hYvh <br>

B. You select "Install boot9strap", reset the system, but the system just boots up normal.<br>
- Go to System Settings > Other Settings > Page 4 > System Update. Make sure to actually attempt to update with wifi on.<br>
It should say "This system is up to date". Press ok and let the system fully reboot to home menu on its own. <br>
Boot b9sTool again.<br>
Choose "Install boot9strap", and hopefully you will see luma3ds config on next reboot.<br>
